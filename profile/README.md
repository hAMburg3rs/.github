# 🧔🏼 !BB

Hello!👋 We are Team !BB, a small, passionate group dedicated to creating open-source games in collaboration with players.  
Our goal is to eventually release a game where we can discuss and refine patch notes together with our community!

Currently, we’re working on a project called [Savor22b](https://github.com/not-blond-beard/Savor22b), a game where players can explore the world alongside living superfoods, crafted from ingredients grown on their farms.

We are committed to making all our work open source and welcome contributions at any time. Our vision is to create a transparent, decentralized game, and to achieve that, we’re using [libplanet](https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet) to build our own blockchain, where all game data is securely stored. We aim to bring players into the development process and build something truly special together!
